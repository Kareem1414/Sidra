## Introduction

Our main scope in this project is to help students manage their educational process in the following domains:

First of all, organizing pupils’ tasks in a unique calendar Students may feel distracted or disappointed as a result of missing assignments or quizzes. Tackling this issue is considered in Sidra. To illustrate, students will use only one app for their tasks as the calendar will be automatically updated when teachers give tasks that need to be done by the deadline.

Secondly, general health At this point, we focus on enhancing the quality of health in regards to sleep, fitness, and healthy food. According to the Ministry of Health, most residents go to sleep so late at night that it directly affects their productivity and focus. In our app, the hours of sleeping and fitness activities are calculated in order to motivate students and show them the amount of time they need each day. Furthermore, parents can track how well their younger children are progressing over time, which is a useful feature.

Another critical matter we consider is the measurement of performance between lecturers and students. Obviously, a quiz and assignment are the best ways to do so. We did our best on this side in order to ensure integrity and enjoyment. To some extent, when doing tests on Sidra, test takers cannot cheat by opening up Google, and if they do so, they will be automatically excluded from the exam. When it comes to mathematics, we include a smart calculator in the app to perform operations accurately.
